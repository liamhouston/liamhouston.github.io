As some of you might know, I've taken the year off of school to reevaluate my interests and hopefully find a clearer vision of what I what to do as a career. 


### The Prelude

Careers are hard man... I decided I needed to take some time off after spending a lonely summer as a research assistant. It seemed like I'd been working for a job in comp sci for so long and then I had it and it didn't feel as perfect as I hoped it would. Honestly, I found myself lost and scared shitless of spending my early 20s just making buttons for FANG (no offence FANG). 

I was worried that people would think I wasn't smart enough or driven enough to be successful. I was worried I'd end up spending the rest of my life living in my parents basement. At about the halfway point of my gap year I can confidently say that both of these fears are bullshit (praying I escape my parents basement).


### How it's Going

I have no clue... I was able to find some part time jobs as a server and selling clothes. I'm constantly talking to strangers and it's helped me figure out how people see me. 

The biggest thing I've realized is I need to work with people. I need to constantly be around people and talk to people. It's such a core tenet of mine and I can't sit quietly coding at my computer. I need to work collaboratively. The challenges feel easier and the victories feel better with a team. The lows aren't as low and the highs are so much higher.

I'm so proud I had the courage to take this time off. It's given me the time to ruminate on what I want to do with myself and how I want to spend my time... not that I have any clue what that is lol.
