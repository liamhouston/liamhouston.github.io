It has taken me a really long time to actually start playing chess. Especially because it seems like something totally up my alley. Very cerebral and lots of problem solving. Beforehand, I thought chess was kind of a silly hobby (I still do sometimes). It seems like significant effort for a game that doesn't really matter. I still feel like this but I've grown more invested in the game. 

Chess has obvious benefits for the health of your brain...

Okay so I wanted to check this assumption... turns out it is not that obvious. Some research suggests chess aids in improving general mathematical abilities: [A study of pupils in Italy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244015596050#:~:text=We%20can%20summarize%20the%20above,%2D%20ning%2C%20abstract%20thought%2C%20calculation) found a strong correlation in mathematical improvement after 3 months of chess practice. However, Sala, the same author reflected in a [meta-analysis of contemporary literature](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5322219/#:~:text=Chess%20may%20be%20beneficial%20for,concentration%20and%20problem%2Dsolving%20skills.) that the empirical evidence of cognitive benefits are not clear. The causal connections between chess and improved cognition do not exist yet. 

Okay that was a bit of a rabbit hole but an interesting one wow. I thought the connection between chess and cognition was much firmer than it seems. Intelligence clearly makes an individual better at chess (I don't need to check this assumption), but it doesn't seem clearly causal that chess improves intelligence.

So maybe I can't claim as clearly that I'm playing for the cognitive benefits. The main fuel I have while playing is my competitiveness. I see myself as a smart guy and I see improvement in chess as a testament to this. There's nothing better than beating a player who has played significantly more games than I have. Seems like a clear signpost of my intellectual abilities. So yeah I'm a little competitive.

On a little bit of a lighter note let me share some of my favourite recent games and puzzles. [Here](https://lichess.org/XSAtpFrP/black#62) is my highest rated victory and my first queen sac. I was very proud of this game and my queen sac caused my opponent to blunder. [My favourite study](https://lichess.org/study/YtBYXc3m) has some beautiful historical checkmates that I've been going through.
Basically I just find the puzzles really fun and it's so satisfying to find a move order to deliver a checkmate in the chaos.

I know I'm nerdy but man it's fun and a good competitive outlet for me. Anyways I think that's all for today. Thanks again for reading! I'm working on finding a good blog style that makes it easy to write and fun to read. Hoping to keep writing about things I find interesting :)))
